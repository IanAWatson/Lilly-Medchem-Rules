Ubuntu
======
Ubuntu remains my primary development environment.

In April 2020 the software was built on Ubuntu 19-10 using
gcc 9.2.1 and zlib-develop 1:1.2.11.

The software will compile with clang 9, and may be slightly faster
than compiling with gcc.

The Intel compiler was usually faster than gcc, but I no longer
have access to that.
